# 1.2 Project Objectives and Scope

## 1.2.1 Project Overview
The CHR Brussels aims to modernize its identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to secure digital operations related to the patient journey.  
The initiative will deploy a unified IAM ecosystem composed of:
- **SailPoint (IGA)** for identity lifecycle automation and governance;
- **Okta (IDP)** for secure authentication, SSO, and adaptive MFA;
- **Wallix (PAM)** for privileged account management and traceability.

## 1.2.2 Business Objectives
- **Enhance patient data protection** by enforcing strong access controls and authentication.
- **Improve operational efficiency** through automated provisioning and deprovisioning.
- **Strengthen compliance** with GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium standards.
- **Support patient journey optimization** by ensuring secure and reliable access to clinical systems (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+).

## 1.2.3 Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Integration of IAM with HR systems (**ULIS** and **Foederis**).
- Secure access to healthcare applications (**DXPlanning**, **QBLOC**, **OASIS+**).
- Establishment of IAM governance processes and compliance controls.
- Implementation of Zero Trust architecture principles across all IAM layers.
- Design and deployment of access review processes for all departments.

**Out of Scope:**
- Development of new HRIS modules or clinical applications.
- Network infrastructure upgrades not related to IAM.
- Integration with third-party systems beyond eHealth APIs (Recip-e, eID, Consent).

## 1.2.4 Key Deliverables
- IAM Target Architecture (Zero Trust-based)
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Use Case Catalog and Process Diagrams
- Compliance & Controls Mapping
- Deployment and Governance Playbooks

## 1.2.5 Success Criteria
- 100% automation of onboarding and offboarding processes.
- MFA adoption for all clinical users.
- Reduction of access-related incidents by 80%.
- Full traceability of privileged access operations.
