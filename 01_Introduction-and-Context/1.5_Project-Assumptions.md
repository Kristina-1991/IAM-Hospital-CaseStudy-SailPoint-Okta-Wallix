# 1.5 Project Assumptions

## 1.5.1 General Assumptions
- HR systems (**ULIS** and **Foederis**) provide accurate, up-to-date employee data.
- Clinical applications (**OASIS+**, **QBLOC**, **DXPlanning**) support API or HL7/FHIR integration.
- The hospitalâ€™s IT infrastructure (network, AD, VPN) supports IAM components.
- The eHealth Belgium APIs (eID, Recip-e, Consent) are accessible and stable.
- Business and clinical stakeholders are available for workshops and UAT sessions.

## 1.5.2 Technical Assumptions
- IAM integrations will use secure protocols (HTTPS, SAML, SCIM, OIDC).
- SailPoint and Okta will be deployed in a hybrid on-premise/cloud environment.
- Wallix Bastion will manage both Linux and Windows privileged sessions.
- Logs and audit trails will be centralized for security monitoring.
- The IAM team will have access to sandbox environments for configuration and testing.

## 1.5.3 Organizational Assumptions
- Executive management validates the IAM roadmap and governance model.
- HR and IT departments collaborate closely for identity lifecycle synchronization.
- A dedicated IAM Business Analyst oversees the end-to-end process documentation.
- End users will participate in MFA adoption and access certification campaigns.

## 1.5.4 Risk-Based Assumptions
If any of these assumptions fail (e.g., unstable API integration or incomplete HR data),  
the IAM scope and timelines may be adjusted through a Change Control process.
