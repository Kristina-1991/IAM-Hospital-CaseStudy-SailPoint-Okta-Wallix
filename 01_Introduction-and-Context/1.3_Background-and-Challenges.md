# 1.3 Background and Challenges

## 1.3.1 Context
The CHR Brussels operates multiple clinical and administrative systems that support the entire patient journey:
- **DXPlanning** initiates and schedules patient appointments;
- **QBLOC** manages surgical operations and operating room schedules;
- **OASIS+** consolidates, stores, and shares patient records.

Currently, user identity and access management are handled manually by the IT department without a centralized IAM framework.  
This fragmented approach exposes the hospital to significant **operational, confidentiality, and compliance risks**.

## 1.3.2 Key Challenges
| Challenge | Description | Impact |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Fragmented identity lifecycle** | User accounts are manually created or deleted with no automation. | Inconsistent access and orphan accounts. |
| **Weak authentication** | No MFA or contextual control for clinical applications. | Risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. |
| **Lack of visibility** | No centralized audit or access reporting. | Difficult to prove compliance to auditors. |
| **Manual role assignment** | Permissions are assigned by individuals without governance. | Misaligned access and role inflation. |
| **Privileged access risks** | Technical accounts are shared or uncontrolled. | High risk of misuse and lack of traceability. |

## 1.3.3 Transformation Rationale
The project seeks to:
- Build a **centralized IAM ecosystem** linking HRIS, clinical apps, and eHealth APIs.
- Align the hospitalâ€™s IT environment with **Zero Trust and EU compliance frameworks**.
- Ensure full **traceability of patient-related operations** and user activities.
- Reduce manual overhead and strengthen accountability.
