# BRD Kick-off Meeting

## Context
This kick-off meeting is initiated by the **IT Security Department of CHR Brussels**, under the sponsorship of the **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**.  
The hospital has mandated an external **consulting firm specialized in Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to support the design and implementation of its future IAM ecosystem.

The goal of this collaboration is to implement an **Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)** solution to automate and secure identity lifecycle management, thereby enhancing the security of day-to-day clinical operations along the patient journey through the deployment of an integrated **Identity Provider (IDP)** and **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** system, while ensuring alignment with European and Belgian healthcare compliance frameworks (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium). 

Currently, CHR Brussels does not operate a centralized IAM capability. User access to critical systems such as **DXPlanning** (patient scheduling), **QBLOC** (surgery block management), and **OASIS+** (electronic medical record) is managed manually.  
This fragmented approach generates major operational and security risks:
- Inconsistent onboarding and offboarding,
- Lack of authentication control,
- Limited audit and traceability,
- Non-compliance with data protection standards.

To address these issues, the CIO has established an **IAM Core Team**, composed of external IAM consultants from the selected consulting firm.  
This multidisciplinary team combines business, architectural, and technical expertise to deliver the first structured phase of the project, the **Business Requirements Document (BRD) v0.1**.

---

## IAM Core Team Composition
| Role | Profile | Scope of Work |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **IAM Business Analyst** | External consultant (IAM / GRC) | Capture business needs, identify operational risks, translate them into IAM requirements, and structure BRD v0.1. Focus on key hospital processes: appointment scheduling, admission, surgery planning, e-prescription, and data access. |
| **IAM Architect** | External consultant (Senior IAM Solution Design) | Define the target IAM capabilities and integration patterns across the three IAM layers: IGA, IDP, PAM. Ensure alignment between business requirements, security controls, and Zero Trust principles. |
| **Solution Architect / Technical Lead** | External consultant (Infrastructure & Integration Specialist) | Validate technical feasibility, define integration mechanisms (APIs, SAML/OIDC, SCIM, HL7), and document system dependencies. Ensure compatibility between IAM components and the hospital IT ecosystem. |

The **objective of this meeting** is to align all stakeholders and formally initiate the **requirements phase** for drafting the **Business Requirements Document (BRD) v0.1** — which will define the functional, technical, and compliance foundations of the IAM transformation.

## Rationale for the IAM Solution Stack
The consulting team conducted a pre-study to evaluate several IAM vendors and selected the following combination for their maturity, interoperability, and healthcare compliance capabilities:

- **SailPoint (IGA)**  
  Provides a robust Identity Governance and Administration layer for automated provisioning, deprovisioning, and role-based access control.  
  SailPoint’s native connectors and governance capabilities make it ideal for HR-driven environments like hospitals, where user lifecycle changes (new hires, rotations, contract ends) are frequent and need to be auditable.

- **Okta (IDP)**  
  Serves as the central authentication layer for Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
  Okta’s adaptive access policies and integration with modern protocols (SAML, OIDC) align perfectly with the hospital’s need for secure, seamless access across DXPlanning, QBLOC, and OASIS+.  
  It ensures fast yet secure authentication, essential in clinical contexts where staff mobility and rapid access are critical.

- **Wallix (PAM)**  
  Selected as the Privileged Access Management solution due to its European origin, strong compliance alignment (NIS2, ISO 27001), and proven reliability in healthcare and public sectors.  
  Wallix provides session recording, vaulted credential management, and full accountability for administrative operations — ensuring auditability and sovereignty over privileged access.

Together, these three solutions form a **Zero Trust IAM framework** that enforces:
- Continuous verification of user identity,
- Least privilege access model,
- Strong authentication and monitoring,
- Full traceability of user and admin activities.

## Purpose of the Meeting
The purpose of this session is to:
- Officially launch the **IAM Business Requirements Definition phase**;
- Align stakeholders on the **project scope, priorities, and compliance objectives**;
- Present the IAM Core Team and their respective roles;
- Validate the selection rationale of **SailPoint, Okta, and Wallix**;
- Confirm dependencies (HRIS data, clinical system APIs, eHealth integration);
- Define the approach and planning for drafting **BRD v0.1**.

---

## Key Discussion Topics
- Current IAM maturity and operational challenges in CHR Brussels.
- Presentation of the IAM vision and regulatory drivers.
- Overview of the IAM architecture and tool selection.
- Roles and responsibilities of the IAM Core Team (BA, Architect, Technical Lead).
- Methodology for producing the BRD v0.1.
- Expected deliverables, risks, and validation timeline.

---

## Meeting Objectives
1. Launch the IAM requirements gathering phase.  
2. Approve the governance structure and confirm the external consulting engagement.  
3. Validate the IAM solution stack (SailPoint, Okta, Wallix).  
4. Agree on the timeline and milestones for BRD v0.1 creation.  
5. Assign responsibilities and confirm next steps.
