# 2.7 Risk Matrix – Impact vs Probability

| **Impact ↓** / **Probability →** | **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | 🟥 R-004, R-005 | 🟥 R-003 | — |
| **High** | — | 🟧 R-001, R-002 | — |
| **Medium** | — | — | — |
| **Low** | — | — | — |

**Legend:**  
🟥 = Critical risk — requires immediate IAM controls (IGA / IDP / PAM).  
🟧 = High risk — to be mitigated through process and access role improvements.  
🟨 = Medium risk — can be monitored or accepted after IAM rollout.  
🟩 = Low risk — negligible impact.

**Interpretation:**  
- Most high-impact risks fall within the *Critical* impact category, even when their probability is low to medium.  
- This pattern reflects healthcare reality: even rare incidents (surgery data change, prescription misuse) can have life-critical consequences.  
- IAM measures therefore target *impact reduction* and *traceability enhancement*, not only probability reduction.
