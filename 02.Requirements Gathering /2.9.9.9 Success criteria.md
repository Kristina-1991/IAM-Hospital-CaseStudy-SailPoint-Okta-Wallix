# 2.11 Success Criteria

## 2.11.1 Objective
The purpose of this section is to define measurable success indicators for the IAM implementation at CHR Brussels.  
These criteria ensure that the project delivers tangible security, compliance, and operational improvements aligned with the hospital’s Zero Trust vision.

## 2.11.2 Success Criteria Overview

| **Category** | **Success Criteria** | **Measurement / KPI** | **Target** | **Validation Method** |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Identity Governance (IGA – SailPoint)** | Automated provisioning and deprovisioning of all users from HRIS (ULIS, Foederis) | % of automated vs manual identity creation | ≥ 95% automation | Audit of HRIS ↔ SailPoint integration logs |
| | Access recertification process implemented for all clinical roles | % of roles reviewed quarterly | 100% of clinical & admin roles | SailPoint compliance reports |
| | Separation of Duties (SoD) controls active | Number of SoD violations detected | ≤ 3 residual violations / quarter | SoD violation reports |
| **Authentication & Access Management (IDP – Okta)** | MFA enforced on all clinical and administrative users | % of users with active MFA | 100% | Okta policy compliance dashboard |
| | eID-based authentication successfully federated with eHealth platform | Successful authentication rate | ≥ 99% | Integration test reports |
| | Context-aware access implemented for OASIS+ (location, device) | % of access requests evaluated by adaptive policies | ≥ 95% | Okta risk scoring logs |
| **Privileged Access Management (PAM – Wallix)** | All privileged accounts (human & technical) vaulted | % of privileged accounts managed by PAM | 100% | PAM inventory & vaulting reports |
| | HL7 service accounts monitored | % of HL7 integrations under PAM control | 100% | Wallix session audit reports |
| | Privileged sessions recorded and traceable | % of critical admin actions recorded | 100% | Session playback verification |
| **Compliance & Governance** | GDPR compliance – Data minimization enforced | % of OASIS+ fields restricted to role | 100% | Functional test audit |
| | NIS2 / ISO 27001 control coverage achieved | Number of applicable controls implemented | 100% | Compliance matrix validation |
| | Audit logs centralized and retained | Retention duration in days | ≥ 365 days | SIEM / PAM / IGA log retention check |

   - Full traceability of privileged and clinical access.

3. **Security & Risk Mitigation**
   - No unauthorized access incidents post go-live.  
   - PAM vaulting in place for all HL7 and API accounts.  
   - MFA + eID authentication adopted hospital-wide.

4. **User Adoption & Training**
   - ≥ 90% user satisfaction score in post-implementation survey.  
   - Training materials (guides, e-learning) delivered to all departments.

## 2.11.4 Deliverables

| **Deliverable** | **Format** | **Description** |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `3.5_Success-Criteria.md` | `.md` | List of success indicators and KPIs |
| `IAM-Success-Metrics.xlsx` | `.xlsx` | Dashboard of measurable IAM KPIs (IGA, IDP, PAM, Compliance) |

## 2.11.5 Summary
The defined success criteria provide a clear and measurable framework to assess IAM implementation maturity within CHR Brussels.  
They ensure the project delivers on its three primary objectives:
- Strengthening data security and patient privacy,  
- Enabling compliant and traceable access to all hospital systems,  
- Supporting long-term IAM governance aligned with Zero Trust and healthcare regulatory frameworks.
