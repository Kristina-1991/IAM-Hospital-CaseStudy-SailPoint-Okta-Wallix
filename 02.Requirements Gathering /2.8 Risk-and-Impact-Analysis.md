# 2.8 Risk and Impact Analysis

## 2.8.1 Context
CHR Brussels handles thousands of patient interactions daily — from appointment scheduling to surgery planning and patient record management.  
Each operation involves sensitive data, critical clinical workflows, and multi-system interactions (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+).

Currently, access to these systems is managed manually. There is limited traceability and inconsistent control over “who can access what and why”.  
This exposes the hospital to operational, confidentiality, and compliance risks that can impact patient safety and regulatory alignment.

This Risk and Impact Analysis provides a structured view of:
- risks associated with core patient journey processes,
- their potential business and clinical impact,
- and IAM mitigation measures (IGA, IDP, PAM) to reduce exposure.

> **Note:**  
> A detailed Risk Register (see annex 3.2.A — `Risk-Register_CHR-IAM.xlsx`) consolidates all identified risks with their probability, ownership, and mitigation status.  
> The table below presents a summarized view of critical risks impacting the hospital’s core patient journey.

## 2.8.2 Consolidated Risk Analysis Table

| **Risk ID** | **Business Process** | **System(s)** | **Risk Description** | **Impact** | **Probability** | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation (IAM Control)** | **Linked BR ID** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **R-001** | Appointment Scheduling | DXPlanning | Unauthorized or erroneous scheduling (wrong patient, double booking) due to lack of access control and traceability. | High | Medium | 🟧 High | Role-based provisioning and access audit (IGA) | BR-001, BR-002 |
| **R-002** | Appointment Scheduling / Integration | DXPlanning ↔ OASIS+ ↔ QBLOC | Technical service accounts used for HL7 exchanges are unmanaged, shared, or reused without traceability, leading to data integrity or confidentiality breaches. | High | Medium | 🟥 Critical | Vaulting and monitoring of HL7 accounts (PAM) | BR-003 |
| **R-003** | Patient Admission | OASIS+ | Reception staff accessing full patient medical records without consent, violating GDPR minimization principle. | High | Medium | 🟧 High | Context-aware access (IDP) + field-level access limitation (IGA) | BR-004, BR-005 |
| **R-004** | Surgery Planning | QBLOC | Unauthorized modification of surgical schedules or clinical resources due to lack of delegation traceability. | Critical | Low | 🟥 Critical | Role delegation and session recording (IGA + PAM) | BR-006, BR-007 |
| **R-005** | Prescription & eHealth | ePrescription / eHealth | Prescription issued without validated therapeutic link or digital signature, exposing the hospital to legal and patient safety risks. | Critical | Low | 🟥 Critical | eID-based strong authentication (IDP + IGA) and privileged backend control (PAM) | BR-008, BR-009 |

## 2.8.3 Risk Scoring Model

| Impact Level | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Direct impact on patient safety, regulatory non-compliance (GDPR, NIS2), or medical liability. |
| **High** | Significant operational disruption or data confidentiality incident. |
| **Medium** | Limited scope or easily recoverable event. |
| **Low** | Minor incident with no impact on patient care or data integrity. |

Each identified risk has been evaluated based on:
- Probability of occurrence  
- Impact on patient safety and continuity of care  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Reversibility

## 2.8.4 Risk Mitigation Summary

| IAM Component | Primary Risk Mitigation Capability |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| **SailPoint (IGA)** | Role-based access control, automated provisioning/deprovisioning, access certification, segregation of duties. |
| **Okta (IDP)** | Strong authentication (MFA, eID), contextual access (device/location), unified SSO auditability. |
| **Wallix (PAM)** | Privileged session recording, credential vaulting, accountability for administrative operations. |

Together, these three layers enforce a **Zero Trust IAM Governance** model, no implicit trust, continuous verification, and full traceability of privileged actions.

## 2.8.5 Conclusion
Without an integrated IAM framework, CHR Brussels remains exposed to:
- operational inefficiencies,  
- potential GDPR / ISO 27799 violations,  
- and risks that directly affect patient safety and clinical accountability.

The adoption of **SailPoint, Okta, and Wallix** significantly reduces these exposures by embedding IAM controls directly into daily operations and patient journey workflows.

This analysis serves as the foundation for:
- the **Business Requirements (Section 3.3)**, and  
- the **Risk Register**, a living artifact continuously updated through the project lifecycle.
