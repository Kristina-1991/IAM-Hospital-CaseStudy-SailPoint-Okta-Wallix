## 5.5.2 Review Workflow

**Step 1 – Preparation**  
- HR updates identity data in ULIS and Foederis.  
- SailPoint compiles current access per user and role.  

**Step 2 – Review Initiation**  
- Department managers receive automated review campaigns.  
- Each manager validates, modifies, or revokes user access.  

**Step 3 – Validation**  
- IAM Core Team verifies changes.  
- Revocations and modifications are processed automatically.  

**Step 4 – Audit and Reporting**  
- Reports generated for compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001 A.9.2.5).  
- Logs archived and validated by CISO.
