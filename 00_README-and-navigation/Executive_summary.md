# Executive summary 

The Centre Hospitalier Régional de Bruxelles (CHR) is undertaking a strategic digital transformation to modernize its Identity and Access Management (IAM) ecosystem and strengthen the security of patient and operational data.

With the increasing complexity of healthcare IT environments, managing user identities and access rights across multiple clinical and administrative systems such as OASIS+, QBLOC, and DXPlanning has become a significant challenge. In addition, the hospital must comply with stringent European and Belgian regulations, including GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium directives.

To address these challenges, the CHR has launched an IAM modernization program built around three core solutions:
- **SailPoint (IGA)** to automate the identity lifecycle, enforce role-based access control, and provide governance and audit capabilities;
- **Okta (IDP)** to deliver secure authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA);
- **Wallix (PAM)** to manage and monitor privileged accounts, enabling full traceability and compliance for critical administrative access.

This program is designed following the principles of the Zero Trust model, ensuring that no user or system is inherently trusted and that every access request is verified, contextual, and auditable.

The initiative aims to:

- Automate onboarding and offboarding processes based on HR data from ULIS and Foederis, reducing manual workload and human error;
- Secure access to critical healthcare systems with strong authentication and least-privilege principles;
- Enhance regulatory compliance and simplify audit preparation through centralized governance and continuous monitoring;
- Support patient journey optimization by improving the reliability and timeliness of access to digital healthcare systems.

Through this implementation, CHR Brussels positions itself as a leader in cyber-resilient healthcare operations, aligning patient care excellence with data protection and European digital sovereignty principles.

The following documentation details the project’s business requirements, target architecture, use cases, and governance framework, all designed from the perspective of an IAM Business Analyst leading the coordination between HR, IT, and Compliance teams.
