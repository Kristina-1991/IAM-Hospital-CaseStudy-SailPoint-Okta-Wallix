# 3.2 Risk and Impact Analysis

## 3.2.1 Context
CHR Brussels handles thousands of patient interactions daily — from appointment scheduling to surgery planning and patient record management.  
Each operation involves sensitive data, critical clinical workflows, and multi-system interactions (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+).

Currently, access to these systems is managed manually. There is limited traceability and inconsistent control over “who can access what and why”.  
This exposes the hospital to operational, confidentiality, and compliance risks that can impact patient safety and regulatory alignment.

This Risk and Impact Analysis provides a structured view of:
- risks associated with core patient journey processes,
- their potential business and clinical impact,
- and IAM mitigation measures (IGA, IDP, PAM) to reduce exposure.

> **Note:**  
> A detailed Risk Register (see annex 3.2.A — `Risk-Register_CHR-IAM.xlsx`) consolidates all identified risks with their probability, ownership, and mitigation status.  
> The table below presents a summarized view of critical risks impacting the hospital’s core patient journey.

## 3.2.2 Consolidated Risk Analysis Table

| # | Process | Risk Category | Description | Impact | IAM Mitigation (IGA / IDP / PAM) | Residual Risk |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Patient Appointment Scheduling (DXPlanning)** | Operational | Double booking, wrong patient, or missed scheduling due to unrestricted access. | High | **IGA (SailPoint):** Enforces role-based access (secretariat vs specialist).<br>**IDP (Okta):** Provides SSO and audit of logins.<br>**PAM (Wallix):** Protects HL7 integration credentials. | Low |
|  |  | Confidentiality | Exposure of patient data during appointment creation by unauthorized staff. | High | **IGA:** Defines least-privilege roles.<br>**IDP:** Enforces MFA for all DXPlanning sessions. | Low |
|  |  | Compliance | Violation of GDPR (data minimization, access justification). | High | **IGA + DPO Review:** Regular access recertification campaigns. | Medium |
| **2** | **Patient Admission & Record Lookup (OASIS+)** | Confidentiality | Unauthorized viewing of patient files, especially in shared or public areas. | High | **IGA:** Field-level restrictions for admission staff.<br>**IDP:** Contextual authentication (device/location). | Low |
|  |  | Operational | Incorrect identification due to manual lookup or missing eHealth consent check. | High | **IDP:** eID-based login & consent validation.<br>**IGA:** Access only to consented records. | Low |
|  |  | Compliance | Breach of GDPR / ISO 27799 on medical data confidentiality. | Critical | **IGA:** Integrates eHealth consent APIs.<br>**PAM:** Audits admin sessions on database. | Low |
| **3** | **Surgery Planning (QBLOC)** | Operational | Incorrect assignment of operating room, staff, or devices due to privilege misuse. | High | **IGA:** Delegation model for chiefs of service.<br>**IDP:** Session continuity between QBLOC & OASIS+.<br>**PAM:** Session recording for privileged modifications. | Medium |
|  |  | Integrity / Fraud | Intentional modification or override of surgical planning. | Critical | **PAM:** “Check-in/check-out” for privileged accounts.<br>**IGA:** SoD between planning and validation. | Low |
|  |  | Compliance | Incomplete audit trail for surgery-related data changes. | High | **PAM:** Full session recording and forensic traceability. | Low |
| **4** | **Room Admission & Discharge (OASIS+)** | Operational | Room booking conflicts, duplicate patient files, inconsistent insurance data. | Medium | **IGA:** Coordinates workflows between HR, admissions, and care units.<br>**IDP:** Unified token across systems. | Low |
|  |  | Compliance | Admission without valid consent or missing patient ID verification. | High | **IDP:** eHealth / eID authentication.<br>**IGA:** Validation rule before admission approval. | Low |
| **5** | **e-Prescription & Medical Acts (OASIS+ / eHealth)** | Identity Fraud | Prescription signed by a non-professional or impersonated user. | Critical | **IDP:** MFA + eID login.<br>**IGA:** Links eHealth ID to hospital role.<br>**PAM:** Secures prescription APIs and audit logs. | Low |
|  |  | Legal / Compliance | Invalid signature or missing traceability for Recip-e transactions. | Critical | **IGA:** Manages professional ID lifecycle.<br>**PAM:** Ensures audit readiness for digital signatures. | Low |

## 3.2.3 Risk Scoring Model

| Impact Level | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Direct impact on patient safety, regulatory non-compliance (GDPR, NIS2), or medical liability. |
| **High** | Significant operational disruption or data confidentiality incident. |
| **Medium** | Limited scope or easily recoverable event. |
| **Low** | Minor incident with no impact on patient care or data integrity. |

Each identified risk has been evaluated based on:
- Probability of occurrence  
- Impact on patient safety and continuity of care  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Reversibility

## 3.2.4 Risk Mitigation Summary

| IAM Component | Primary Risk Mitigation Capability |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| **SailPoint (IGA)** | Role-based access control, automated provisioning/deprovisioning, access certification, segregation of duties. |
| **Okta (IDP)** | Strong authentication (MFA, eID), contextual access (device/location), unified SSO auditability. |
| **Wallix (PAM)** | Privileged session recording, credential vaulting, accountability for administrative operations. |

Together, these three layers enforce a **Zero Trust IAM Governance** model, no implicit trust, continuous verification, and full traceability of privileged actions.

## 3.2.5 Conclusion
Without an integrated IAM framework, CHR Brussels remains exposed to:
- operational inefficiencies,  
- potential GDPR / ISO 27799 violations,  
- and risks that directly affect patient safety and clinical accountability.

The adoption of **SailPoint, Okta, and Wallix** significantly reduces these exposures by embedding IAM controls directly into daily operations and patient journey workflows.

This analysis serves as the foundation for:
- the **Business Requirements (Section 3.3)**, and  
- the **Risk Register**, a living artifact continuously updated through the project lifecycle.
