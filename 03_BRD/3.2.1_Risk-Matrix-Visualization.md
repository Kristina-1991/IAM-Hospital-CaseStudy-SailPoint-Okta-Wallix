### 3.2.5 Risk Matrix â€“ Impact vs Probability

| **Impact â†“** / **Probability â†’** | **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | ðŸŸ¥ R-004, R-005 | ðŸŸ¥ R-003 | â€” |
| **High** | â€” | ðŸŸ§ R-001, R-002 | â€” |
| **Medium** | â€” | â€” | â€” |
| **Low** | â€” | â€” | â€” |

**Legend:**  
ðŸŸ¥ = Critical risk â€” requires immediate IAM controls (IGA / IDP / PAM).  
ðŸŸ§ = High risk â€” to be mitigated through process and access role improvements.  
ðŸŸ¨ = Medium risk â€” can be monitored or accepted after IAM rollout.  
ðŸŸ© = Low risk â€” negligible impact.

**Interpretation:**  
- Most high-impact risks fall within the *Critical* impact category, even when their probability is low to medium.  
- This pattern reflects healthcare reality: even rare incidents (surgery data change, prescription misuse) can have life-critical consequences.  
- IAM measures therefore target *impact reduction* and *traceability enhancement*, not only probability reduction.
