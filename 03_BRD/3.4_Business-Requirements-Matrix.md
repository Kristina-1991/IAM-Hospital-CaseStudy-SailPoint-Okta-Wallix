# 3.4 Business Requirements Matrix

## 3.4.1 Objective
This section consolidates the business requirements derived from the IAM Solution Mapping (Section 3.3) and the Risk Analysis (Section 3.2).  
Each requirement ensures secure, compliant, and traceable management of identities and access rights within CHR Brussels’ hospital systems.

## 3.4.5 Summary
This Business Requirements Matrix establishes a unified view of the hospital’s IAM governance framework.  
It ensures that each clinical operation — from appointment scheduling to prescription issuance — complies with Zero Trust principles and regulatory mandates.  
The next phase (3.5) will define the **Success Criteria**, measuring how effectively these requirements mitigate risks and strengthen compliance posture.
