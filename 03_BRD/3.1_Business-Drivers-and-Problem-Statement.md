# 3.1 Business Drivers and Problem Statement

## 3.1.1 Business Context
CHR Brussels is responsible for delivering safe, high-quality patient care while operating under strict regulatory, privacy, and continuity-of-care obligations.

The hospital relies on three core applications to support the patient journey:
- **DXPlanning** – patient appointment scheduling and specialist allocation,
- **QBLOC** – surgical block planning, operating room allocation, consent tracking,
- **OASIS+** – consolidation of the full patient record, clinical documentation, medical history and admission details.

Today, access to these systems is managed manually by IT on request. There is no centralized identity and access management platform, and user onboarding, role assignment, and deprovisioning are not automated.

As clinical services scale and staffing models become more dynamic (rotation, on-call specialists, external consultants, temporary staff), this manual approach is no longer sustainable from a security, compliance, or operational efficiency standpoint.

## 3.1.2 Problem Statement
The hospital currently faces the following structural issues:

- **No end-to-end identity lifecycle control**  
  User accounts are created and modified on demand. Accounts are often not revoked on time when a contract ends or a function changes.

- **Lack of consistent access policies across systems**  
  DXPlanning, QBLOC, and OASIS+ each apply their own logic for roles and permissions. There is no global view of “who has access to what, and why”.

- **Insufficient authentication strength and session traceability**  
  There is no single source of authentication with MFA, and it is difficult to prove who accessed patient data and under which level of authorization.

- **Regulatory exposure**  
  The current model does not provide the level of auditability and accountability expected under GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, or eHealth Belgium obligations (consent management, patient identity verification, professional identity binding for prescription).

- **Operational risk for the patient journey**  
  Errors in scheduling, incorrect admission, uncontrolled modification of surgical plans, or access to the wrong patient file can directly impact continuity of care and medical liability.

## 3.1.3 Strategic Drivers
The IAM program is driven by the following strategic needs:

1. **Protect patient data and clinical integrity**  
   Ensure that only the right person, with the right role, at the right time, can access or modify patient-related information.

2. **Support compliance and audit readiness**  
   Be able to demonstrate, at any time, who had access to which dataset, under which justification, and for how long.

3. **Reduce manual workload and human error**  
   Automate provisioning, access assignment, and deprovisioning based on HR data coming from ULIS and Foederis.

4. **Enable Zero Trust by design**  
   Move away from implicit trust (“you’re on the network so you’re allowed”) to contextual, verified access with strong authentication and least privilege.

5. **Stabilize mission-critical hospital operations**  
   Secure the processes that define the patient journey:
   - Appointment creation and modification,
   - Patient admission and record lookup,
   - Surgery planning and OR resource allocation,
   - e-Prescription signing and compliance.

## 3.1.4 Target IAM Capabilities
To meet these drivers, CHR Brussels plans to implement an integrated IAM stack composed of:

- **SailPoint (IGA)**  
  Identity Governance & Administration covering:
  - automatic onboarding/offboarding based on HR data,
  - role-based access and separation of duties,
  - periodic access reviews and certifications.

- **Okta (IDP)**  
  Identity Provider covering:
  - strong authentication (MFA),
  - SSO across DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+,
  - contextual access rules aligned with Zero Trust.

- **Wallix (PAM)**  
  Privileged Access Management covering:
  - vaulting of high-risk credentials (admin / technical accounts),
  - session recording and auditability,
  - accountability for elevated actions on systems handling patient data.

This stack has been selected for its ability to:
- enforce least privilege,
- improve traceability,
- accelerate incident investigation,
- and align with EU sovereignty and healthcare compliance expectations.

## 3.1.5 BRD Objective
The goal of the Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to formalize:
- the business risks,
- the functional requirements,
- and the IAM controls needed to protect the patient journey.

This document (BRD v0.1) will serve as the foundation for:
- target IAM architecture design,
- integration planning for SailPoint, Okta, and Wallix,
- and regulatory alignment with GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium.

The BRD will be refined and reissued as **BRD v1.0** once requirements are validated with stakeholders (IT Security, Clinical Application Owners, HR, DPO).
