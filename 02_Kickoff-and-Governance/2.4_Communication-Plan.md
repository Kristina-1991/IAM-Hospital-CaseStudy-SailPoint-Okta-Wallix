# 2.5 Communication Plan

## Context
The IAM Transformation Program at CHR Brussels involves multiple stakeholder groups: hospital leadership, IT Security, HR, clinical application owners (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+), compliance, and end-user representatives from medical and administrative teams.

Because this program directly impacts how users authenticate, access patient data, schedule interventions, and manage admissions, communication cannot be treated as a purely technical activity. It is an essential success factor for adoption, auditability, and operational continuity.

This Communication Plan defines:
- how information will circulate between the IAM Core Team (external consulting team) and CHR Brussels stakeholders,
- how decisions will be escalated, validated, and recorded,
- how changes will be announced to impacted users (clinical staff, secretaries, admission staff, IT administrators),
- and how we ensure traceability of approvals for compliance purposes (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, eHealth Belgium).

The plan supports three parallel needs:
1. **Delivery governance** – keeping sponsors and management aligned on progress, risks, and decisions.
2. **Business engagement** – ensuring that process owners (admission, surgery, scheduling) validate requirements and operating scenarios that will be documented in BRD v0.1 and BRD v1.
3. **Change readiness** – preparing the organization for new IAM practices such as MFA, SSO, role-based access, privileged access monitoring, and access review processes.

## Objectives of the Communication Plan
- Establish a clear, predictable communication rhythm across all streams (requirements, architecture, compliance, UAT, go-live).
- Define who is informed of what, when, and through which channel.
- Prevent misalignment between IT Security, HR, and clinical operations.
- Provide evidence of structured communication for audit and regulatory purposes.
- Support the controlled rollout of SailPoint (IGA), Okta (IDP), and Wallix (PAM), without disrupting critical hospital operations.

## Scope
This Communication Plan applies to:
- Internal stakeholders at CHR Brussels (CIO, IT Security, HRIS, Application Owners, DPO).
- The external IAM Core Team (Business Analyst, IAM Architect, Solution Architect).
- End-user representatives involved in UAT and pilot phases.
- Technology vendors (SailPoint, Okta, Wallix) when escalation or clarification is required.

The plan covers the full lifecycle of the engagement:
1. Analysis & BRD definition (BRD v0.1),
2. Target design and validation (BRD v1),
3. User Acceptance Testing,
4. Deployment preparation,
5. Handover to operational governance.

Communication is therefore treated as a controlled workstream, not an afterthought.

## Communication Principles
- **Transparency:** project updates and key decisions are shared systematically.  
- **Traceability:** all major communications (decisions, approvals) are archived in the shared project workspace.  
- **Consistency:** a single source of truth (Teams channel + SharePoint) ensures all documents are up-to-date.  
- **Accessibility:** all stakeholders can access the documentation repository (BRD, RACI, Risk Register, etc.).  
- **Auditability:** meeting minutes and approval logs are retained as compliance evidence.
