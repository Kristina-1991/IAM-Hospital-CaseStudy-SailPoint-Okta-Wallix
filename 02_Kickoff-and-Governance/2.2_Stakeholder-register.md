# 2.2 Stakeholder Register

## Context
The stakeholder register identifies all key participants involved in the **CHR Brussels IAM Transformation Program**.  
This register ensures clarity on each stakeholder’s **role, influence, interest, and responsibilities** throughout the project lifecycle.

The IAM initiative is a **joint effort between CHR Brussels and an external consulting firm** specializing in Identity and Access Management (IAM).  
The consulting firm provides a **Core IAM Team** composed of a Business Analyst, an IAM Architect, and a Solution Architect — all working closely with the hospital’s IT, HR, and compliance departments.

Effective stakeholder alignment is essential for producing a coherent **Business Requirements Document (BRD v0.1)** and achieving the program’s strategic objectives: regulatory compliance, Zero Trust adoption, and secure patient data management.

## Engagement Principles
- **Transparency:** All stakeholders have access to up-to-date project documentation through a shared project workspace.  
- **Accountability:** Each deliverable (BRD, architecture, risk register) has a clear owner and validation path.  
- **Compliance-driven:** All stakeholders must consider GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, and eHealth regulations in their decisions.  
- **Zero Trust alignment:** IAM decisions are guided by least privilege, continuous verification, and traceability principles.  
- **Feedback loop:** Regular workshops and validation sessions ensure that business needs remain aligned with IAM design choices.

## Next Steps
- Validate the stakeholder register and confirm engagement owners.  
- Share this register with all project participants after the Kick-off Meeting.  
- Maintain updates throughout the project lifecycle as stakeholders evolve.  
- Use this register as a reference for the **BRD v0.1 validation** and subsequent architecture workshops.
