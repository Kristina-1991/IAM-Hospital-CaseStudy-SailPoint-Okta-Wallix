# 2.3 RACI Matrix

## Purpose
This RACI matrix defines who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for key workstreams of the IAM transformation program at CHR Brussels.

The IAM program is delivered by an external consulting team (IAM Core Team) working together with internal stakeholders from IT Security, HR, Clinical Applications, and Compliance.

- **R = Responsible**: executes the work
- **A = Accountable**: final owner / decision authority
- **C = Consulted**: provides input, must be involved
- **I = Informed**: kept aware of progress and decisions

## Notes
- The CIO remains Accountable for strategic alignment and funding.
- IT Security acts as Project Owner and is Accountable for security outcomes and regulatory compliance.
- The IAM Core Team (consultants) is Responsible for analysis, documentation, and design.
- Clinical Application Owners and HRIS Owners are Responsible for their perimeter in run mode: they validate that the designed IAM model works with real-life operations.
- The DPO / Compliance is Accountable for GDPR / ISO 27799 conformity and must sign off before go-live.

## Governance Deliverables
- RACI Matrix (this document) – baseline.
- Stakeholder Register – 2.2_Stakeholder-Register.md.
- Communication Plan – defines how each stakeholder is kept engaged/informed.

These governance deliverables will be referenced in BRD v1.0.
