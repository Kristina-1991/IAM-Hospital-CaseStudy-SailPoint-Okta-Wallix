# Executive Summary 

The Brussels Regional Hospital Center (CHR) is embarking on a strategic digital transformation to modernize its Identity and Access Management (IAM) ecosystem, enhancing the security of patient and operational data while ensuring compliance with stringent European and Belgian regulations including GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium directives. 

With the increasing complexity of clinical and administrative systems such as OASIS+, QBLOC, and DXPlanning, managing user identities and access rights has become a critical challenge. To address this, CHR has initiated an IAM modernization program centered on three core solutions:

- **SailPoint (IGA)** : automates identity lifecycle management, enforces role-based access control, and provides governance and audit capabilities,
- **Okta (IDP)** delivers secure authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA),
- **Wallix (PAM)** manages and monitors privileged accounts ensuring full traceability and compliance for critical administrative access.

This program follows the Zero Trust model principles, ensuring that no user or system is inherently trusted and all access requests are verified, contextualized, and auditable.

Key objectives include:

- Automating onboarding and offboarding processes leveraging HR data from ULIS and Foederis to reduce manual workload and human error,
- Securing critical healthcare system access through strong authentication and least privilege principles, 
- Enhancing regulatory compliance and simplifying audit preparation via centralized governance and continuous monitoring,
- Supporting patient journey optimization by improving the reliability and timeliness of access to digital healthcare systems.

Through this implementation, CHR Brussels positions itself as a leader in cyber-resilient healthcare operations, aligning patient care excellence with data protection and European digital sovereignty principles.
