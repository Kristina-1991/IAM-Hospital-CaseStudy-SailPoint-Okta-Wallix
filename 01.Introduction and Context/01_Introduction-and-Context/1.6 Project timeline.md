# Project Timeline

## Overview
The IAM Transformation Program at CHR Brussels will be delivered in phases.  
Each phase produces formal deliverables that will either:
- feed the BRD,
- validate the design,
- or prepare operational readiness.

The timeline below assumes a progressive rollout:
1. Analysis & Definition
2. Design & Validation
3. Implementation Readiness
4. Go-Live Preparation
5. Handover & Governance

## High-Level Timeline 

### Phase 1 — Analysis & Definition  
**Duration:** Week 1 → Week 4  
**Objective:** Understand the current state, document business needs, and capture risks.  
**Key Activities:**

- Definition of technical integration assumptions (SSO, MFA, provisioning, PAM session recording).
- Modelling of critical hospital processes in BPMN (AS-IS / TO-BE).
- Definition of role model and access governance model.
- Review sessions with Compliance (GDPR / NIS2 / ISO 27001 / ISO 27799).

**Key Deliverables:**
- 5.1_High-Level-Architecture.md  
- 5.2_TO-BE-Architecture-Diagram.png  
- 5.3_Technical-Interfaces-and-APIs.md  
- 5.4_Data-Flows-and-Role-Model.md  
- `/04_Process-Analysis/BPMN_AS-IS_*.png`  
- `/04_Process-Analysis/BPMN_TO-BE_*.png`  
- 6.x Use Case files (one per operation: DXPlanning, OASIS+, QBLOC, Admission, e-Prescription)  
- **BRD_V1.pdf (validated version of the BRD)**

### Phase 3 — Implementation Readiness  
**Duration:** Week 9 → Week 11  
**Objective:** Prepare the organization for deployment.  
**Key Activities:**
- Define access review process and recertification campaigns in SailPoint.
- Define MFA and SSO enforcement strategy in Okta for clinical users.
- Define privileged access monitoring approach with Wallix.
- Prepare UAT scope and test cases.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 5.5_Access-Review-Process.md  
- 7.1_UAT-Plan.md  
- 7.2_UAT-Cases.xlsx  
- 7.3_Validation-Checklist.md  
- 7.4_UAT-Report.md (post-execution)  
- Draft Deployment Strategy outline.

---

### Phase 4 — Go-Live Preparation  
**Duration:** Week 12 → Week 13  
**Objective:** Ensure the IAM solutions can be rolled out with minimal disruption.  
**Key Activities:**
- Finalize rollout sequencing (Okta, then SailPoint, then Wallix).
- Define communication and user training plan.
- Define support/hypercare model with IT Security and Application Owners.
- Prepare rollback and contingency plan.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 8.1_Deployment-Strategy.md  
- 8.2_Go-Live-Checklist.md  
- 8.3_Knowledge-Transfer-Plan.md  
- 8.4_Support-and-Monitoring.md  

---

### Phase 5 — Handover & Governance  
**Duration:** Week 14 → Week 15  
**Objective:** Transition IAM into operational governance.  
**Key Activities:**
- Define ownership of access review cycles (HR / App Owners / IT Security).
- Define KPIs and compliance dashboarding.
- Document continuous improvement roadmap.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 9.1_KPI-and-Dashboard.md  
- 9.2_Continuous-Improvement-Plan.md  
- 9.3_Audit-Readiness-Checklist.md  

---

## Visual Timeline (Milestones)
- **Week 1:** Kick-off / Governance confirmed  
- **Week 4:** BRD_V01.md drafted  
- **Week 8:** BRD_V1.pdf validated + Target Architecture defined  
- **Week 11:** UAT Plan + Access Review Process defined  
- **Week 13:** Deployment Strategy and Go-Live Readiness Package  
- **Week 15:** Governance & KPI model handed over to the CHR Brussels IT Security team

## Dependency Notes
- Availability of HRIS data (ULIS / Foederis) is critical for provisioning design.  
- eHealth integration (eID, consent, Recip-e) is mandatory for prescription and access to OASIS+.  
- Clinical stakeholders (surgery, admissions, reception) must be engaged early for UAT realism.  
- Compliance (DPO) must sign off on any access model involving patient data.
