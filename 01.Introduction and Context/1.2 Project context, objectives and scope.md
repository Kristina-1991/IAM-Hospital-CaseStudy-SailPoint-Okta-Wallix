# Cybersecurity Audit and Project Rationale
The management of the Brussels Regional Hospital Center (CHR) initiated a comprehensive cybersecurity audit by engaging an independent penetration tester to assess the hospital’s digital infrastructure and security posture. The audit identified critical gaps requiring the implementation of a comprehensive IAM ecosystem encompassing Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Identity Provider (IDP), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) components.

These findings highlighted significant weaknesses, particularly in identity lifecycle automation, governance controls such as Segregation of Duties (SoD), access review campaigns, and privileged account management, which pose operational, confidentiality, and compliance risks, especially regarding healthcare data protection under ISO 27799.

In response, the CHR allocated a preliminary budget of approximately €500,000 and contracted an international consulting firm to provide dedicated expertise for launching this foundational IAM program. This partnership aims to align the hospital’s IT environment with Zero Trust principles and European regulatory frameworks, reducing manual tasks, enhancing traceability, and improving overall cyber resilience.

## Project Overview 

The CHR is committed to implementing a full IAM ecosystem to secure digital processes through the patient journey, deploying:

- **SailPoint** for identity governance and lifecycle management (IGA),

- **Okta** for secure authentication and Single Sign-On (IDP),

- **Wallix** for privileged account control and monitoring (PAM).


## Business Objectives

- Strengthen patient data protection by enforcing robust access controls and ensuring least privilege access.

- Increase operational efficiency through automated provisioning and deprovisioning processes, improving speed, scale, and simplicity.

- Achieve full compliance with healthcare sector regulations including GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium standards.

- Support patient care optimization by ensuring secure, reliable access to clinical systems (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+).

## Project Scope
*In Scope:*

- Integration of IAM with HR systems (ULIS, Foederis).

- Securing access to healthcare applications (DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+).

- Establishing governance processes and compliance controls based on Zero Trust principles.

- Designing and implementing regular access review workflows.

*Out of Scope:*

- Development of new HRIS modules or clinical applications—consider whether this is relevant or should be clarified.

- Network infrastructure upgrades unrelated to IAM.

- Integration with third-party systems beyond standard eHealth APIs.

## Key Deliverables

- Zero Trust-based IAM Target Architecture

- Business Requirements Document (BRD)

- Use Case Catalog and Process Diagrams

- Compliance and Controls Mapping

- Deployment and Governance Playbooks

## Success Criteria

- Achieve 100% automation of IGA activities, particularly onboarding and offboarding.

- Deploy MFA for all clinical users and personnel involved in patient care and IAM management.

- Reduce access-related incidents by 80%.

- Ensure full compliance and traceability of privileged account activities.

# Background and Challenges
## Context
CHR operates multiple clinical and administrative systems supporting patient care: 
- DXPlanning manages appointments,
- QBLOC controls surgical workflows,
- and OASIS+ consolidates patient records.

Currently, IAM processes are manual and fragmented, exposing the hospital to risks in operational efficiency, confidentiality, and compliance.

## Key challenges 

| **Challenge** | **Description** | **Impact** |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Lack of IGA Governance| Slow, manual onboarding/offboarding, no segregation of Duties, absence of certification campaigns and access review processes| Orphan accounts, excessive access rights, regulatory non-compliance| 
|Absence of MFA| No multi-factor authentication on clinical applications| Elevated risk of unauthorized access and data breaches|
| Uncontrolled Privileged Access| Shared or unmanaged privileged accounts with no traceability| High risk of misuse and absence of audit trails|
| Non-compliance with ISO 27799| Lack of specific controls to protect healthcare data per ISO standards | Increased legal and regulatory exposure|

## Transformation rationale 

This project aims to: 
- Centralize and streamline the IAM ecosystem, integrating clinical application and eHealth APIs.
- Align the hospital's IT environment with Zero Trust principles and EU regulatory frameworks.
- Ensure full traceability and accountability of user actions.
- Reduce manual intervention, improving operational efficiency and security posture.
