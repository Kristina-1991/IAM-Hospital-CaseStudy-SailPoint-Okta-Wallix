# 5.0.1 AS IS & TO BE BPMN 
## 5.0.1.1 Consultant approach
The approach to requirements gathering for BPMN diagram creation is based on a rigorous and participative methodology that ensures all business needs are thoroughly captured and formalized. The first step involves performing a comprehensive assessment of existing environment. That includes reviewing current identity and access management processes and business through interviews and analysis of organizational documention to map out the current state and understand key priorities. 
Collaborative workshops are organized with business and technical stakeholders. These sessions aim to clarify operational procedures, collect functional needs from each entity involved, and document pain points and desired improvements. 
The work is iterative, esuring every voice is heard and all relevant business scenario covered. The information is synthesized into process models and requirements documents, which are then validated with stakeholders. This collaborative validation ensures accuracy and mutual understanding while enabling early identitfication of inconsistencies or overlooked needs. 
BPMN diagrams are drafted based on validated requirements. Further review sessions are held to presenet the diagrams, allowing for all stakeholder feedback and iterative refinement until a common, operationally viable view is reached. 
All final diagrams are archived and shared as deliverables, ensuring that the functional vision is traceable and can serve both implementation and future process optimization work. 

## 5.0.2 Process 1 – Appointment Scheduling (DXPlanning)
In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).
## 5.0.2.1 Actors 
- Patient
- Medical secretary

## 5.0.2.2 Systems involved 
- DXPlanning

## 5.0.2.3 Identified risks & ISO27799 threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
| Unauthenticated access to DXPlanning by secretaries| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Appointment entered for the wrong patient|User error |
|Unauthorized modification of appointment data|Masquerade by insiders|
|No audit trail for created appointments|Repudiation|

## 5.0.2.6 Benefits

| **Process Step** | **Solution** | **Benefit** |
|------------------|----------|----------|
|Workstation Login| Personal account with enhanced MFA (badge + PIN code) | Strengthened authentication security reducing unauthorized access | 
| SSO Authentication| SSO with OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect| Seamsless user experience with centralized and secure authentication |
|Access to DxPlanning| Using SSO for session initiation| Quick and secure access to the application, less repetitive logins|
|Access Rights management (RBAC| RBAC applied for “medical secretary” role (read, write, modify, create patient| Precise permission control aligned with job function|
|Contextual Access Control (ABAC)| ABAC rules applied (“no medical content allowed”)|Protection of sensitive medical data ensuring confidentiality compliance|

## 5.0.3 Process 2 – Patient Admission (OASIS+)
In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).
## 5.0.3.1 Actors 
- Patient
- Reception agent

## 5.0.3.2 Systems invovled 
- Oasis+ 

## 5.0.3.3 Identified risks & ISO27799 threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
|Reception agent accessing full patient record| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Accidental access to the wrong patient file|User error |
|Access from shared terminals without authentication|Masquerade by insiders|
|Potential exposure of patient data|Communications interception|
|No logging of data access|Repudiation|

*Figure 3 - AS-IS Patient admission (OASIS+)*

## 5.0.3.5 BPMN TO BE 
This model complies with recommendations for identity vigilance, user access management and rights administration within a modern hospital. It significantly improves the security, traceability and compliance of the patient care process.

## 5.0.3.6 Benefits

This table outlines the secured patient admission process enhanced with IAM (Okta), centralized identity management (IDP), and privileged access management (PAM) for improved security, compliance, and patient data integrity in a hospital setting.

| **Process Step** | **Solution** | **Benefit** |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Patient is pre-registered| Receptionist agent logs in with MFA via Okta (IDP)| Enhanced security with strong authentication and access traceability | 
| Access OASIS+ system| Single sign-on (SSO) with OAuth 2.0 + OIDC, role-based access control (RBAC) and segregation of duties (SoD) enforcement| Fine-grained access control preventing unauthorized data access|
| Search for patient record | Verify using national ID number, name, and date of birth| Accurate patient identification, reducing errors|
| Patient record not found| Create new administrative patient file with validation via national registry| Ensure data reliability and regulatory compliance | 
| Verify insurance coverage | OASIS+ checks patient’s insurance status | Confirm valid insurance to prevent billing issues|
| Confirm admission | Finalize admission with logged operations| Complete audit trail for accountability and compliance|
