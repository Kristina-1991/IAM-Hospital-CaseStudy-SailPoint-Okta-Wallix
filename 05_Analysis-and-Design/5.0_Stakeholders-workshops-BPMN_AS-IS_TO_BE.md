# 5.0.1 AS IS & TO BE BPMN 
## 5.0.1.1 Consultant approach
The approach to requirements gathering for BPMN diagram creation is based on a rigorous and participative methodology that ensures all business needs are thoroughly captured and formalized. The first step involves performing a comprehensive assessment of existing environment. That includes reviewing current identity and access management processes and business through interviews and analysis of organizational documention to map out the current state and understand key priorities. 
Collaborative workshops are organized with business and technical stakeholders. These sessions aim to clarify operational procedures, collect functional needs from each entity involved, and document pain points and desired improvements. 
The work is iterative, esuring every voice is heard and all relevant business scenario covered. The information is synthesized into process models and requirements documents, which are then validated with stakeholders. This collaborative validation ensures accuracy and mutual understanding while enabling early identitfication of inconsistencies or overlooked needs. 
BPMN diagrams are drafted based on validated requirements. Further review sessions are held to presenet the diagrams, allowing for all stakeholder feedback and iterative refinement until a common, operationally viable view is reached. 
All final diagrams are archived and shared as deliverables, ensuring that the functional vision is traceable and can serve both implementation and future process optimization work. 

## 5.0.2 Process 1 – Appointment Scheduling (DXPlanning)
In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).

## Client IAM procedure development ##
As an IAM consultant, after conducting interviews analyzing and validate the "TO BE BPMN" workflows, , I assisted the client in developing a specific, tailored robust, role-based and auditable procedure for surgery planning. My involvement ensured the integration of strong authentication, access controls, and traceability aligned with leading industry practices, thereby enhancing the security and governance of critical hospital systems managing patient admission and surgery planning.

## IAM Procedure for Patient Admission and Surgery Planning ##
### Purpose ### 
To ensure secure, auditable, and compliant identity and access management controls are implemented for patient admission and surgery planning systems within the hospital's IT environment.
### Scope ###
Applicable to all hospital staff involved in patient admission (reception agents) and surgical planning (surgeons, anesthetists, room coordinators) using systems such as OASIS+ and QBLOC.

### Responsibilities
- Reception Agents, Surgeons, Anesthetists, Room Coordinators: Authenticate securely and perform only authorized actions based on assigned roles.
- IAM Administrators: Configure and maintain identity providers, RBAC, MFA, and logging infrastructure.
- Compliance Officers: Monitor audits, review access logs, and enforce soD policies.

### Procedure Steps
1. **User Authentication and Access Control**

    - All users must authenticate via the hospital’s Identity Provider (Okta) employing MFA and Single Sign-On (SSO) using OAuth 2.0 + OIDC.

    - Access to OASIS+ and QBLOC is controlled via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensuring segregation of duties (SoD). Admission staff access is limited to administrative actions; surgical staff have role-specific capabilities.

2. **Patient Admission Process**

    - Reception agents search for patient records using validated identifiers (national number, name, DOB).

    - If no record is found, agents create a new patient file with validation against the national registry.

    - Insurance coverage is verified automatically; admission proceeds only if coverage is valid.

    - All steps are logged with timestamps and user identifiers for auditability.

3. **Surgery Planning Process**

    - Surgeons initiate surgery requests by entering required procedure details in QBLOC after secure login.

    - QBLOC performs automated patient identity and episode verification by querying OASIS+.

    - Room coordinators allocate operating room slots and select anesthetists; all actions logged.

    - Anesthetists receive notifications and authenticate via Okta to review and validate requests.

    - Final surgery scheduling triggers automated dispatch to relevant teams and systems, with full traceability.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**

    - All authentication events, record creations, modifications, and scheduling operations must be logged.

    - IAM administrators perform periodic access reviews and implement corrective actions when SoD violations or anomalies are detected.

5. **Incident Management**

    - Any suspicious access or compromise attempts must be reported immediately through the hospital’s security incident response process.

6. **Training and Awareness**

    - All users must receive regular training on secure access procedures and their responsibilities within IAM.

7. **Review and Update**

    - This procedure is reviewed annually or upon significant process or system changes to maintain effectiveness and compliance.

## 5.0.5 Process 4 - Medication prescription (ePrescription / OASIS+) 
Prescriptions are currently issued manually without strong authentication or automated therapeutic link verification.
The process lacks digital signature enforcement, leading to potential identity misuse and non-compliance with eHealth and Recip-e standards.
