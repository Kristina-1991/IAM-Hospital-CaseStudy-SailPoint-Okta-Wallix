# 5.0.1 AS IS & TO BE BPMN 
## 5.0.1.1 Consultant approach
The approach to requirements gathering for BPMN diagram creation is based on a rigorous and participative methodology that ensures all business needs are thoroughly captured and formalized. The first step involves performing a comprehensive assessment of existing environment. That includes reviewing current identity and access management processes and business through interviews and analysis of organizational documention to map out the current state and understand key priorities. 
Collaborative workshops are organized with business and technical stakeholders. These sessions aim to clarify operational procedures, collect functional needs from each entity involved, and document pain points and desired improvements. 
The work is iterative, esuring every voice is heard and all relevant business scenario covered. The information is synthesized into process models and requirements documents, which are then validated with stakeholders. This collaborative validation ensures accuracy and mutual understanding while enabling early identitfication of inconsistencies or overlooked needs. 
BPMN diagrams are drafted based on validated requirements. Further review sessions are held to presenet the diagrams, allowing for all stakeholder feedback and iterative refinement until a common, operationally viable view is reached. 
All final diagrams are archived and shared as deliverables, ensuring that the functional vision is traceable and can serve both implementation and future process optimization work. 

## 5.0.2 Process 1 – Appointment Scheduling (DXPlanning)
In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).
## 5.0.2.1 Actors 
- Patient
- Medical secretary

## 5.0.2.2 Systems involved 
- DXPlanning

## 5.0.2.3 Identified risks & ISO27799 threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
| Unauthenticated access to DXPlanning by secretaries| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Appointment entered for the wrong patient|User error |
|Unauthorized modification of appointment data|Masquerade by insiders|
|No audit trail for created appointments|Repudiation|

### 5.0.5.7 Client IAM procedure development 
As an IAM consultant, after conducting interviews, analyzing, and validating the "TO BE" BPMN workflows for patient admission, surgery planning, medication prescription, and appointment scheduling, I assisted the client in developing a specific, tailored, robust, role-based, and auditable IAM procedure. My involvement ensured the integration of strong authentication mechanisms such as MFA and SSO, precise access controls via RBAC and ABAC, and comprehensive traceability aligned with leading industry practices. This procedure significantly enhances the security, compliance, and governance of critical hospital systems managing these vital healthcare processes, thereby supporting operational efficiency and protecting sensitive patient information.
