# 5.2 IAM Solution Mapping

## 5.2.1 Purpose

This section defines how each IAM component — **SailPoint (IGA)**, **Okta (IDP)**, and **Wallix (PAM)** — addresses the functional and regulatory gaps identified in the risk analysis (Section 3.2).  
The goal is to provide a clear functional mapping of IAM solutions across the hospital’s critical applications: **DXPlanning**, **OASIS+**, **QBLOC**, and **ePrescription/eHealth**.

## 5.2.2 Overview of the IAM Architecture

The CHR Brussels IAM program is designed around the **Zero Trust model**, ensuring that no user, system, or device is inherently trusted.  
Access to patient-related data and clinical systems must be continuously verified, context-aware, and traceable.

| **IAM Layer** | **Solution** | **Core Functionality** | **Integration Role** |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **IGA** | SailPoint | Role management, joiner-mover-leaver automation, access certification, SoD policy enforcement | Synchronizes identities from HRIS (ULIS, Foederis) and provisions them to hospital systems (DXPlanning, OASIS+, QBLOC) |
| **IDP** | Okta | Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), adaptive access | Federates authentication across clinical systems and ensures secure eID/eHealth access |
| **PAM** | Wallix Bastion | Privileged account vaulting, session recording, audit of administrative access | Protects and monitors elevated accounts used for system integrations, HL7 data flows, and application administration |

## 5.2.3 IAM Solution Coverage by Business Process

| **Business Process** | **Primary Systems** | **IGA (SailPoint)** | **IDP (Okta)** | **PAM (Wallix)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **1. Appointment Scheduling** | DXPlanning | Role-based access (secretaries, medical assistants) | SSO + MFA for all users | Vaulting of technical HL7 accounts |
| **2. Patient Admission and Record Lookup** | OASIS+ | Access limited by function (reception, nurse, doctor) | Context-aware login (location/device) | Session recording for admin maintenance |
| **3. Surgery Planning** | QBLOC | Delegated authorization for surgeons and chiefs | SSO federation between QBLOC and OASIS+ | Audit of privileged actions (schedule modifications) |
| **4. Prescription and eHealth** | ePrescription / eID | Identity link between hospital user and eID | MFA and digital signature orchestration | Vaulted access to API and backend servers |

---

## 5.2.4 Solution Interoperability

The three layers of IAM operate in a **complementary and interconnected** manner:

1. **IGA (SailPoint)** manages *who* should have access, defining identity lifecycle and role governance.
2. **IDP (Okta)** governs *how* the user authenticates and under which conditions (Zero Trust principles).
3. **PAM (Wallix)** controls *what privileged actions* can be performed and ensures auditability.

Example Flow:
> When a new doctor is onboarded in **ULIS (HRIS)**, SailPoint automatically creates the identity and assigns roles for OASIS+ and QBLOC.  
> Okta enforces strong authentication via SSO and MFA.  
> If the doctor requires access to system configurations (e.g., QBLOC admin), Wallix grants a time-bound privileged session recorded for audit purposes.

## 5.2.5 Compliance Integration

| **Regulation / Standard** | **Supported by** | **IAM Capability** | **Example** |
|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **GDPR – Art.5, 32** | SailPoint | Access control & least privilege | Role-based provisioning and recertification |
| **NIS2 – Annex I** | Okta / Wallix | Authentication, traceability | MFA, privileged session audit |
| **ISO 27001 / 27799** | All | Security controls for healthcare information | Identity lifecycle, incident traceability |
| **eHealth Belgium** | Okta | eID federation & signature binding | Authentication with eHealth card and MFA |

## 5.2.6 Deliverables

| **Deliverable** | **Format** | **Description** |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `3.3_IAM-Solution-Mapping.md` | `.md` | Functional mapping of IAM solutions |
| `IAM-Architecture-Diagram.png` | `.png` | Visual schema showing SailPoint, Okta, Wallix integration flows |
| `IAM-Dataflow-Diagram.png` | `.png` | Data flow between HRIS, IAM stack, and hospital systems |
| `Solution-Mapping-Table.xlsx` | `.xlsx` | Optional Excel version of the above mapping |

## 5.2.7 Summary

The IAM ecosystem proposed for CHR Brussels ensures:
- **Separation of duties** between identity governance, authentication, and privilege control.
- **Traceability** of every user session and data access.
- **Compliance** with healthcare and cybersecurity regulations.
- A **Zero Trust posture** tailored to the hospital’s operational and patient safety requirements.

The next step (Section 3.4) will define the **Business Requirements Matrix**, linking these IAM capabilities to specific risk mitigations and measurable success criteria.
