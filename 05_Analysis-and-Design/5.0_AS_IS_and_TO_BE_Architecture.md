# 5.0.1 AS IS & TO BE Architecture 
## 5.0.2 Consultant approach

## 5.0.3 Process 1 – Appointment Scheduling (DXPlanning)
In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).

### Identified risk & threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
| Unauthenticated access to DXPlanning by secretaries| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Appointment entered for the wrong patient|User error |
|Unauthorized modification of appointment data|Masquerade by insiders|
|No audit trail for created appointments|Repudiation|

### BPMN AS IS

## 5.0.4 Process 2 – Patient Admission (OASIS+)

In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).

### Identified risk & threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
|Reception agent accessing full patient record| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Accidental access to the wrong patient file|User error |
|Access from shared terminals without authentication|Masquerade by insiders|
|Potential exposure of patient data|Communications interception|
|No logging of data access|Repudiation|

## 5.0.5 Process 3 - Surgery Planning (QBLOC)
Currently, QBLOC can be accessed by any hospital staff member using shared credentials or unprotected sessions.
Surgery schedules can be modified without validation or traceability, leading to potential data integrity breaches and patient safety risks.

### Identified risk & threats

| **Risk** | **ISO27799 threat** | 
|------------------|----------|
|Uncontrolled modification of surgery schedules| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|No validation before saving changes|User error |
|No audit trail or accountability|Repudiation|
|Shared credentials between staff|Masquerade by insiders|
|Incorrect resource allocation impacting surgery|Operator error|
