In the current process, front-desk agents access OASIS+ through generic terminals without authentication or contextual restrictions.
Full patient records are visible regardless of the agent’s role or location, creating a privacy and compliance risk (GDPR Art. 32).

|------------------|----------|
| Unauthenticated access to DXPlanning by secretaries| Unauthorized use of a health information application | 
|Appointment entered for the wrong patient|User error |
|Unauthorized modification of appointment data|Masquerade by insiders|
|No audit trail for created appointments|Repudiation|
