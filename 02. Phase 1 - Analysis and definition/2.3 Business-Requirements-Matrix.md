# Business Requirements Matrix

## Objective
This section consolidates the business requirements derived from the IAM Solution Mapping (Section 3.3) and the Risk Analysis (Section 3.2).  
Each requirement ensures secure, compliant, and traceable management of identities and access rights within CHR Brussels’ hospital systems.

| **BR-002** | Appointment Scheduling | DXPlanning | All DXPlanning users must authenticate via Okta SSO with MFA enforced. | Okta (IDP) | NIS2 Annex I – Authentication | R-002 |
| **BR-003** | Appointment Scheduling / Inter-System Communication | DXPlanning ↔ OASIS+ ↔ QBLOC | All service accounts used for HL7 data exchanges between hospital systems (DXPlanning, OASIS+, QBLOC) must be vaulted and monitored within Wallix PAM to ensure credential protection, traceability, and prevention of unauthorized access. | Wallix (PAM) | ISO 27001 A.9.2.3 – Management of privileged access credentials | R-001 |
| **BR-004** | Patient Admission | OASIS+ | Reception staff can only view fields relevant to admission and consent verification. | SailPoint (IGA) | GDPR Art.5 – Data Minimization | R-003 |

## Summary
This Business Requirements Matrix establishes a unified view of the hospital’s IAM governance framework.  
It ensures that each clinical operation — from appointment scheduling to prescription issuance — complies with Zero Trust principles and regulatory mandates.  
The next phase (3.5) will define the **Success Criteria**, measuring how effectively these requirements mitigate risks and strengthen compliance posture.
