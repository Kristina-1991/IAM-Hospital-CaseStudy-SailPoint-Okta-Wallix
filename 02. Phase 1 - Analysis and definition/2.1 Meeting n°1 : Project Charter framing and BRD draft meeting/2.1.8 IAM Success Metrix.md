# IAM Success Metrics 
## 1. Objectives / Purpose 

The purpose of the IAM Success Metrics section is to define how the effectiveness of the SailPoint, Okta, Wallix implementation will be measured throughout the project lifecycle and after go-live.
These metrics ensure that the IAM transformation delivers measurable improvements in:

- **Security posture** (NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, GDPR)
- **Operational efficiency** (automation, reduced workload, reduced onboarding delays)
- **User experience** (simplified and secured access for clinical staff)
- **Governance and auditability** (traceability, compliance reporting, SoD controls)

This section acts as a baseline for steering, and as a validation framework for the client and stakeholders to confirm that the IAM program meets business expectations.

## 2. IAM Consultant Approach 
To design robust and measurable IAM success KPIs, the consulting team applies the following methodology:

### Step 1 – Identify Business Drivers

Link each KPI to one of the drivers established in the BRD:

- Patient safety
- Regulatory compliance
- Operational continuity
- Data minimization
- Audit traceability

### Step 2 - Map Drivers → IAM Capabilities

Ensure each driver is connected to: 

- Identity Governace (SailPoint)
- Authentication & Federation (Okta)
- Privileged Access Management (Wallix)

### Step 3 - Define SMART metrics 
Each KPI follows the SMART structure: 
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

### Step 4 - Establish Validation Method

For each metric, define: 

- Measurement source (logs, dashboards, audi reports, certification results)
- Validation process (monthly review, quarterly governance committee, annual audit)

 ### Step 5 - align KPIs with Compliance Requirements
 Cross-reference the KPIs with: 

 - ISO 27001 Annex A controls
 - NIS2 requirements
 - ISO27799 sector-specific requirements
 - Belgian eHealth integration standards

## 4. IAM Success Metrics - Dashboard Overview 

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a concise overview of the key performance indicators for the IAM programme IGA (SailPoint), IDP (Okta), PAM (Wallix) that can be consulted at a glance.
This format facilitates:

- communication with management,
- justification of IAM design decisions,
- demonstration of programme maturity,
- assessment of the path to compliance (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799).

The dashboard below is based on the KPIs of the success matrix, but translates them into a visual format, classified into three statuses:

🟩 On Track – target achieved or ahead of schedule
🟨 At Risk – partial progress, risk identified
🟥 Critical – off target, immediate action required
