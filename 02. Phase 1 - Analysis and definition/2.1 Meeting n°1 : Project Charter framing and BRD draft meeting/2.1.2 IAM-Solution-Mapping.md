# IAM Solution Mapping

## Purpose

This section defines how each IAM component — **SailPoint (IGA), Okta (IDP), and Wallix (PAM)** — addresses the functional and regulatory gaps highlighted in the risk analysis (Section 2.1.4).
Its objective is to provide a clear functional mapping of IAM solutions across the hospital’s critical applications: DXPlanning, OASIS+, QBLOC, and ePrescription/eHealth.

## Overview of the IAM Architecture

Access to patient-related data and clinical systems must be continuously verified, context-aware, and traceable.
The CHR Brussels IAM program will be designed around the Zero Trust model, ensuring that no user, system, or device is inherently trusted.

**1.** **Verify Explicitly**

Every access request, whether from users, devices, or systems—whether inside or outside the hospital network must be thoroughly authenticated and authorized before granting access to patient data or clinical systems.

**2.** **Use Least Privilege Access**

Access rights are strictly limited to the minimal necessary privileges needed for each role. For example, doctors get time-limited access to relevant patient records, nurses have more restricted access, and administrative staff have only access required for their functions.

**3.** **Assume Breach**

The hospital network architecture assumes that breaches can and will occur. Continuous monitoring, segmentation, and strict access controls limit the lateral movement of attackers and reduce the impact of any compromise.

**4.** **Context-Aware Access**

Access decisions incorporate contextual factors such as user role, device health, location, time of day, and behavior patterns, reducing risks from stolen credentials or unauthorized devices.

**5.** **Microsegmentation and Isolation**

Hospital devices (including critical medical devices and Internet of Medical Things - IoMT) and systems are segmented and isolated on the network to prevent a single compromised device from exposing the entire infrastructure.

**6.** **Continuous Monitoring and Analytics**

Real-time monitoring of user activities, device posture, and network traffic helps detect anomalies early. Automated responses can temporarily block suspicious sessions or require re-authentication.

**7.** **Comprehensive Logging and Audit**

All access and actions are logged with fine granularity. This is essential not only for security incident investigations but also for compliance with healthcare regulations such as GDPR, NIS2, and eHealth Belgium.

By applying these Zero Trust principles, CHR Brussels ensures that every user, device, and system interaction is validated and secured to protect the integrity and confidentiality of patient data, enable regulatory compliance, and maintain continuity of high-quality care.


| **IAM Layer** | **Solution** | **Core Functionality** | **Integration Role** |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **IGA** | SailPoint | Role management, joiner-mover-leaver automation, access certification, SoD policy enforcement | Synchronizes identities from HRIS (ULIS, Foederis) and provisions them to hospital systems (DXPlanning, OASIS+, QBLOC) |
| **IDP** | Okta | Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), adaptive access | Federates authentication across clinical systems and ensures secure eID/eHealth access |
| **PAM** | Wallix Bastion | Privileged account vaulting, session recording, audit of administrative access | Protects and monitors elevated accounts used for system integrations, HL7 data flows, and application administration |

## IAM Solution Coverage by Business Process

| **Business Process** | **Primary Systems** | **IGA (SailPoint)** | **IDP (Okta)** | **PAM (Wallix)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **1. Appointment Scheduling** | DXPlanning | Role-based access (secretaries, medical assistants) | SSO + MFA for all users | Vaulting of technical HL7 accounts |
| **2. Patient Admission and Record Lookup** | OASIS+ | Access limited by function (reception, nurse, doctor) | Context-aware login (location/device) | Session recording for admin maintenance |
| **3. Surgery Planning** | QBLOC | Delegated authorization for surgeons and chiefs | SSO federation between QBLOC and OASIS+ | Audit of privileged actions (schedule modifications) |
| **4. Prescription and eHealth** | ePrescription / eID | Identity link between hospital user and eID | MFA and digital signature orchestration | Vaulted access to API and backend servers |

## Solution Interoperability

The three layers of IAM operate in a **complementary and interconnected** manner:

1. **IGA (SailPoint)** manages *who* should have access, defining identity lifecycle and role governance.
2. **IDP (Okta)** governs *how* the user authenticates and under which conditions (Zero Trust principles).
3. **PAM (Wallix)** controls *what privileged actions* can be performed and ensures auditability.

Example Flow:
> When a new doctor is onboarded in **ULIS (HRIS)**, SailPoint automatically creates the identity and assigns roles for OASIS+ and QBLOC.  
> Okta enforces strong authentication via SSO and MFA.  
> If the doctor requires access to system configurations (e.g., QBLOC admin), Wallix grants a time-bound privileged session recorded for audit purposes.

## Compliance Integration

| **Regulation / Standard** | **Supported by** | **IAM Capability** | **Example** |
|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **GDPR – Art.5, 32** | SailPoint | Access control & least privilege | Role-based provisioning and recertification |
| **NIS2 – Annex I** | Okta / Wallix | Authentication, traceability | MFA, privileged session audit |
| **ISO 27001 / 27799** | All | Security controls for healthcare information | Identity lifecycle, incident traceability |
| **eHealth Belgium** | Okta | eID federation & signature binding | Authentication with eHealth card and MFA |

## Summary

The IAM ecosystem proposed for CHR Brussels ensures:
- **Separation of duties** between identity governance, authentication, and privilege control.
- **Traceability** of every user session and data access.
- **Compliance** with healthcare and cybersecurity regulations.
- A **Zero Trust posture** tailored to the hospital’s operational and patient safety requirements.

The next step (Section 3.4) will define the **Business Requirements Matrix**, linking these IAM capabilities to specific risk mitigations and measurable success criteria.
