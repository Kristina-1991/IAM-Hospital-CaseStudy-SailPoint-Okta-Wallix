## Legend and Assessment assumptions 
### Impact levels (vertical axis) 
Impact is evaluated qualitatively based on the potential consequences of the risk on clinical operations, patient safety, regulatory compliance, and data confidentiality.

| Level            | Definition                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 – Very Low** | Minor disruption, no patient impact, no sensitive data exposure.                                           |
| **2 – Low**      | Limited operational disruption, minimal data exposure.                                                     |
| **3 – Medium**   | Noticeable operational impact, exposure of non-critical health data, minor compliance deviation.           |
| **4 – High**     | Significant disruption, potential impact on patient care, exposure of sensitive data, GDPR non-compliance. |
| **5 – Critical** | Severe patient safety risk, major operational breakdown, large-scale data breach, legal consequences.      |

### Probability levels (horizontal axis)
Probability reflects the likelihood of occurrence based on current (AS-IS) controls, workflow maturity, and historical incidents in healthcare environments.

| Level                 | Definition                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 – Very unlikely** | Rare occurrence, strong existing controls.                      |
| **2 – Unlikely**      | Could occur but not expected under normal conditions.           |
| **3 – Possible**      | Occurs occasionally; process weaknesses exist.                  |
| **4 – Likely**        | Has occurred or is expected to occur frequently.                |
| **5 – Very likely**   | High recurrence rate; lack of controls makes it almost certain. |

### Risk level calculation 
Risk level = **Impact x Probability** 

Color coding: 

- 🟥 High risk (≥ 16) → Action required immediately
- 🟧 Medium risk (9–15) → Priority treatment
- 🟨 Low risk (4–8) → Mitigate progressively
- 🟩 Very low (< 4) → Monitor

## Interpretation
### Highest risks (Critical zone – must be addressed first)

- R13 – Unauthorized use of health information applications
→ Direct linkage to ISO27799 + GDPR + patient safety.

### High risks (priority for IAM controls)

- Appointment scheduling without authentication
- Full-file access during patient admission
- Prescription without therapeutic link
- Surgery schedule modification without traceability
- Contractor access not revoked
- Emergency access without audit

### Medium risks (address with policies / technical safeguards)

- Incorrect scheduling or resource allocation
- Research environment misuses
- Theft of devices
