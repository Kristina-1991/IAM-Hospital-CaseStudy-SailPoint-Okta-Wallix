# Business Requirements Matrix

## Objective
This section consolidates the business requirements derived from the IAM Solution Mapping (Section 2.1.2) and the Risk Analysis (Section 2.1.4).  
Each requirement ensures secure, compliant, and traceable management of identities and access rights within CHR Brussels’ hospital systems.
