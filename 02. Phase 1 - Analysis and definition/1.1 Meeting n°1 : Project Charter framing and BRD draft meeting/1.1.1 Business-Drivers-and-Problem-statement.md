# Business Drivers and Problem Statement

## Business Context
The hospital relies on three core applications to support **the patient journey**:

- **DXPlanning**: A comprehensive patient scheduling and specialist allocation system, managing appointment booking, cancellations, resource availability, and calendar synchronization. It supports efficient patient flow and reduces no-shows through automated reminders, while also interfacing with clinical information systems to ensure seamless access to patient data during scheduling and follow-up.

- **QBLOC**: A modular surgical block management solution designed to optimize operating room scheduling, resource allocation, and surgical team coordination. It includes pre-operative planning, per-operative data entry (such as procedure details, anesthesia, and medical consumables), consent tracking, and real-time visualization of operating room status. QBloc ensures rigorous traceability and timestamping of all surgical events, enabling audit compliance and operational performance analysis through integrated reporting and business intelligence tools.

- **OASIS+**: An integrated clinical platform consolidating the full patient electronic record, including inpatient and outpatient clinical documentation, medical history, laboratory results, diagnostic information, and admission details. It enables healthcare providers to access up-to-date comprehensive patient information to support clinical decision-making, continuity of care, and regulatory reporting. The platform supports interoperability standards (such as HL7) enabling smooth exchanges with other hospital systems.

Currently, access to these systems is managed manually by IT upon request. There is no centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform, and user onboarding, role assignments, and deprovisioning processes are not automated.

In addition, certain critical user roles require a robust centralized IAM ecosystem to address their unique access needs:

- **Emergency physicians** who require immediate and uninterrupted access to specific systems in urgent situations, necessitating IAM processes that enable emergency access without compromising security.

- **External contractors or IT technicians** who need temporary and strictly limited access for maintenance or support activities, supported by strong controls to ensure timely deprovisioning and enforcement of the principle of least privilege.

- **Researchers** accessing pseudonymized patient data under strict compliance constraints, requiring fine-grained access controls that balance data protection with enabling research activities.

These profiles introduce specific challenges that the IAM system must address to maintain security, compliance, and operational efficiency as clinical services expand and staffing models become more dynamic, including rotations, on-call specialists, external consultants, and temporary staff.

As the hospital’s clinical services scale, the current manual access management approach is no longer sustainable from security, compliance, or operational efficiency perspectives. 
Consequently, implementing a centralized, automated, and secure IAM solution is essential to meet present and future organizational needs.

## Problem Statement
The hospital currently faces several structural challenges regarding identity and access management:

- **No end-to-end identity lifecycle control**
  
Clinical user accounts are created and modified manually on demand. Accounts are often not revoked promptly following contract termination or role changes. In some administrative areas, accounts may be shared, increasing risk.

- **Lack of consistent access policies across systems**

DXPlanning, QBLOC, and OASIS+ each implement their own role and permission management logic, without a centralized view of “who has access to what, and why.”

- **Insufficient authentication strength and session traceability**

There is no unified authentication source with multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement. It is challenging to prove who accessed sensitive patient data and with what level of authorization, jeopardizing accountability and traceability.

- **Regulatory exposure**

The existing IAM model does not meet auditability and accountability requirements demanded by GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium regulations, including consent management, patient identity verification, and professional binding for prescriptions.

- **Operational risks impacting patient care**

Errors in scheduling, admissions, surgical planning, or access to incorrect patient records present significant risks to continuity of care and medical liability.

- **Specific challenges arising from critical user profiles:**

  - **Emergency physicians** require immediate and uninterrupted access to critical systems during urgent situations, demanding IAM processes that allow fast emergency access while upholding security.

  - **External contractors** and IT technicians need temporary, limited access for maintenance and support, requiring stringent controls for timely deprovisioning and least-privilege enforcement.

  - **Researchers** accessing pseudonymized patient data operate under strict compliance constraints, necessitating fine-grained access controls to balance data protection and research needs.

These issues collectively undermine the hospital’s ability to maintain a secure, compliant, and efficient IAM environment as clinical services grow more complex and staffing models become increasingly dynamic.

## Strategic Drivers
The IAM program is driven by the following strategic needs:

**1.** **Protect patient data and clinical integrity**
   
Ensure that only authorized individuals with the appropriate roles at the right time can access or modify patient-related information.

**2.** **Support compliance and audit readiness**
   
Maintain the ability to demonstrate, at any time, who accessed which data, under what justification, and for how long, in accordance with GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, and other relevant healthcare regulations.

**3.** **Reduce manual workload and human error**
   
Automate user provisioning, access assignment, and deprovisioning based on HR data flows from ULIS and Foederis systems to improve operational efficiency and minimize risks.

**4.** **Implement Zero Trust architecture by design**
   
Transition from implicit trust models (e.g., "on the network means allowed") to contextual, verified access that enforces strong authentication and least privilege principles.

**5.** **Stabilize mission-critical hospital operations**
    
Secure and streamline key processes that define the patient journey, including appointment creation and modification, patient admission and record lookup, surgical planning and operating room resource allocation, as well as e-prescription signing and regulatory compliance.

## Target IAM Capabilities
To meet these strategic drivers and based on advice provided by the IAM core team, CHR Brussels plans to implement the following integrated IAM stack:

- **SailPoint (IGA)**  
  Identity Governance & Administration covering:
  - automatic onboarding/offboarding based on HR data,
  - role-based access and separation of duties,
  - periodic access reviews and certifications.

- **Okta (IDP)**  
  Identity Provider covering:
  - strong authentication (MFA),
  - SSO across DXPlanning, QBLOC, OASIS+,
  - contextual access rules aligned with Zero Trust.

- **Wallix (PAM)**  
  Privileged Access Management covering:
  - vaulting of high-risk credentials (admin / technical accounts),
  - session recording and auditability,
  - accountability for elevated actions on systems handling patient data.

This stack has been selected for its ability to:
- enforce least privilege,
- improve traceability,
- accelerate incident investigation,
- and comply with EU sovereignty and healthcare regulatory standards.

## BRD Objective
The goal of the Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to formalize:
- the business risks,
- the functional requirements,
- and the IAM controls needed to protect the patient journey.

This document (BRD v0.1) will serve as the foundation for:
- target IAM architecture design,
- integration planning for SailPoint, Okta, and Wallix,
- and regulatory alignment with GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001, ISO 27799, and eHealth Belgium.

The BRD will be refined and reissued as **BRD v1.0** once requirements are validated with stakeholders (IT Security, Clinical Application Owners, HR, DPO).
